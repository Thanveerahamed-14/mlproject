Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project applies various machine learning models to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on patient health data. The dataset used is the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset (PIDD) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Several machine learning models have been implemented and evaluated, including:

Logistic Regression (LR)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Naive Bayes (NB)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Random Forest (RF)
Decision Tree (DT)
AdaBoost (AB)
Neural Networks (NN)

Dataset
The Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset (PIDD) consists of 768 records of female patients, with the following attributes:

Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration after 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
Skin Thickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
Diabetes Pedigree Function: A score that estimates the likelihood of diabetes based on family history
Age: Age in years
Outcome: Target variable (0 for non-diabetic, 1 for diabetic)

Models Implemented
>Logistic Regression (LR)
>Support Vector Machine (SVM)
>Naive Bayes (NB)
>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
>Random Forest (RF)
>Decision Tree (DT)
>AdaBoost (AB)
>Neural Networks (NN)

Each model has been evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation were used to improve the performance of the models.
