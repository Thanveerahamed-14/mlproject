This project applies various machine learning models to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on patient health data. The dataset used is the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset (PIDD) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Several machine learning models have been implemented and evaluated, including:

Logistic Regression (LR)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Naive Bayes (NB)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Random Forest (RF)
Decision Tree (DT)
AdaBoost (AB)
Neural Networks (NN)

Each model has been evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation were used to improve the performance of the models.
